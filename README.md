700 homework.
In this taks, I design a network for sorting hand writting image
The ConNTM.py contains all code for the combination of CNN and NTM
Besides, the conlistm.py is the network combines CNN and LSTM for images sorting.
Even though the performance of both work is not good, but the accuracy is surely improved by training.
cnn.pkl and lstm.pkl is the pytorch parameters file which saves the pretrained cnn and lstm, you could go into py file
to choose whether to use them.
